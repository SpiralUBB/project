# WebApp setup

Install [node.js 14.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) or greater

## Development server

On first run and after file additions you have to run `npm install`
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
